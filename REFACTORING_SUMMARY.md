# SalesAI Project Refactoring Summary

## Overview
The SalesAI project has been successfully refactored to follow a clean architecture pattern with proper separation of concerns. The monolithic DAG has been broken down into thin task wrappers and heavy business logic has been moved to dedicated source modules.

## New Project Structure

```

## Key Improvements

### 1. Separation of Concerns
- **DAGs**: Now contain only Airflow orchestration logic
- **Tasks**: Thin wrappers that delegate to business logic modules
- **Src**: Heavy business logic isolated in dedicated modules

### 2. Better Maintainability
- Each module has a single responsibility
- Easier to test individual components
- Clearer code organization

### 3. Reusability
- Business logic modules can be reused across different DAGs
- Task wrappers can be easily modified without touching core logic

### 4. Testability
- Individual modules can be unit tested in isolation
- Mocking is easier with clear interfaces

## Module Descriptions

### Task Wrappers (`tasks/`)
- **data_extraction_tasks.py**: Wrappers for data generation and validation
- **model_training_tasks.py**: Wrappers for model training and evaluation
- **model_deployment_tasks.py**: Wrappers for model deployment and reporting

### Source Modules (`src/`)
- **data_extraction.py**: Handles synthetic data generation
- **data_validation.py**: Validates data quality and completeness
- **model_training.py**: Prepares data and trains ML models
- **model_evaluation.py**: Evaluates models and selects best performer
- **model_deployment.py**: Registers and transitions models to production
- **reporting.py**: Generates performance reports
- **cleanup.py**: Handles cleanup operations

## Usage

### Running the Refactored DAG
The new refactored DAG (`sales_forecast_training_refactored`) can be used as a drop-in replacement for the original DAG. It provides the same functionality but with better organization.

### Adding New Features
1. Add business logic to appropriate `src/` module
2. Create thin wrapper in `tasks/` if needed
3. Update DAG to use new wrapper

### Testing
- Unit tests can be written for individual `src/` modules
- Integration tests can test the task wrappers
- DAG tests can verify the orchestration logic

## Migration Notes

- The original DAG (`sales_forecast_training.py`) is preserved for reference
- All existing functionality has been maintained
- Import paths have been updated to work with the new structure
- The refactored DAG uses the same Airflow variables and configuration

## Benefits Achieved

1. **Cleaner Code**: DAG is now much more readable and focused on orchestration
2. **Better Organization**: Related functionality is grouped together
3. **Easier Testing**: Individual components can be tested in isolation
4. **Improved Maintainability**: Changes to business logic don't require DAG modifications
5. **Enhanced Reusability**: Modules can be reused across different workflows
